# What is Powershell?

The featured snippet on Google says PowerShell is an interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) and automation engine designed by Microsoft to help design system configurations and automate administrative tasks. Microsoft says PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. I say PowerShell is a CLI to Windows and beyond!

## A history of Command Lines and Windows

In 1985, Microsoft released Windows 1.0. At this point in time, Windows, along with all other Operating Systems, are primarily terminals, which interact with the hardware through the command line.  Windows 2.0 and Windows 3.0 and their future patches, are also predominantly terminals also. 

Then comes Windows 95. This the first full Windows release featuring a GUI for the user to interact with. Because this whole interface is new, and computers are now being shipped with this new "mouse" thing, Windows includes games like Solitaire and Minesweeper. It also includes "Command.com", the predecessor to cmd.exe, and Windows 95's portal to the command line. 

Active Directory is still a little way from being released, so in order to give administrators a chance to administer machines, Microsoft adds a bunch of little .exe files that can make changes to the operating system that improve management of machines
## How do I use it though?

Well, if you have a Windows computer, click Start, and type PowerShell. Alternatively, right-click the start icon, and click PowerShell.

Either way, you'll be met with the blue box with a white blinking cursor.
