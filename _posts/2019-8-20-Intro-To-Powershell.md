## What is Powershell?

The featured snippet on Google says PowerShell is an interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI) and automation engine designed by Microsoft to help design system configurations and automate administrative tasks. Microsoft says PowerShell is a task-based command-line shell and scripting language built on .NET. I say PowerShell is a CLI to Windows and beyond!

### How do I use it though?

Well, if you have a Windows computer, click Start, and type PowerShell. Alternatively, right-click the start icon, and click PowerShell.

Either way, you'll be met with the blue box with a white blinking cursor.
