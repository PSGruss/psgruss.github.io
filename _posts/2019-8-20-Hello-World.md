# I DID IT!

I made my first blog post! Following [these instructions](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), I think you can do it too! Now, I just need to learn how to format in MarkDown, and think of something interesting to say...

In the meantime, here's a little about myself!

### About Me

My name is John Gruss. I'm a nerd, and knew I was destined for an IT career when I was 12, and tore apart the family computer to fix it without a clue of what I was doing. I'm a big fan of animals, music, Pittsburgh sports teams, and PowerShell. I'm not a big fan of soccer. 

#### My Career

I started my IT career at a small company in south-west Pennsylvania while I was in school. They were good people with great ambitions, and helped me grow myself into what I've become!

I started working at The George Washington University in 2011 at the help desk, answering calls and resetting passwords. After using the awesome training benefits that GW provides to get my A+, I moved to the desktop support team. I then used those same benefits to learn PowerShell, and landed in my current position. 

#### Why does this matter?

I've been doing some interesting things with PowerShell recently that I'd love to share with the community. I also would like to revisit some basic concepts to give back to the community. I plan to update this site with some PowerShell posts for beginners and experts alike, so stay tuned!
