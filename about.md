My name is John Gruss. I'm a nerd, and knew I was destined for an IT career when I was 12, and tore apart the family computer to fix it without a clue of what I was doing. I'm a big fan of animals, music, Pittsburgh sports teams, and PowerShell. I'm not a big fan of soccer.

### More Information

I started working at The George Washington University in 2011 at the help desk, answering calls and resetting passwords. After using the awesome training benefits that GW provides to get my A+, I moved to the desktop support team. I then used those same benefits to learn PowerShell, and landed in my current position.
