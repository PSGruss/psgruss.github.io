My name is John Gruss. I'm a nerd, and knew I was destined for an IT career when I was 12, and tore apart the family computer to fix it without a clue of what I was doing. I'm a big fan of animals, sudokus, music, Pittsburgh sports teams, and PowerShell. I'm not a big fan of soccer.

### More Information

I started working at a university in Washington DC. I started learning about Powershell about 2-3 years ago through the Powershell path on Pluralsights. Since then, I've been using that knowledge to seek career advancements and automate our various work tasks. Our organization uses Active Directory, Group Policy, Microsoft System Center and Configuration Manager (SCCM), and various implementations of VMware's Horizon products for VDI.
